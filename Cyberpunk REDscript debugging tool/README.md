## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### Manual Library Loading Analysis
For deeper analysis, you can run library loading commands manually:

```bash
# Check what libraries are being loaded
cd "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/MacOS"
DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 ./Cyberpunk2077

# Check library dependencies
otool -L "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/Frameworks/libBink2MacArm64.dylib"
```

### Permission Repair
To fix permission issues system-wide:

```bash
# Repair game permissions
sudo chown -R $USER:staff "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077"
sudo chmod -R 755 "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077"

# Make executable
chmod +x "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/Cyberpunk2077.app/Contents/MacOS/Cyberpunk2077"
```

### REDscript Manual Compilation
If automatic compilation fails:

```bash
# Navigate to mod directory
cd "/Applications/Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/mod"

# Manual compilation (if REDscript compiler is available)
# This depends on your specific REDscript setup
```
